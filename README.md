analyzed data to provide insights into drug usage trends, patterns, and demographics within Connecticut. The dashboard is a powerful tool for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to understand the dynamics of drug consumption in the state of Connecticut.

Key features of our dashboard include:
- Visualizations of drug consumption trends over time
- Geographic distribution of drug usage hotspots
- Demographic breakdown of drug users
- Comparison of different drug categories
- Impact analysis on healthcare and social systems
We went a step further, developing a predictive model to forecast deaths over the next 4 years
